PyExam
=======

<i><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> This project is alpha at best. I'm mainly releasing this to free up some room for other projects.</i>

PyExam is a simple testing framework for running tests after executing commands (on the command line duh). The original purpose was to test speed of execution of command line utilities, but it has been expanded to be a more general purpose tool.

For number based results it also provides aggregation tools and formatting.

An example command would be: python tester.py debug_test.txt

Current Test Cases:
--------
* Speed - Test execution of command line utilites
* Size - Check size of files after command line utilities run
* Debug - Return a random int from 1-100 for each test case
